# Tabber internationalisation

This repository is aimed to keep translations in one distinct place, in order to separate tabber's software from it's internationalisation.
Tabber will download the very last versions of translations here, even when there's no software update.

### Currently available languages :

* Français - *French*
* English
* Deutsch - *German* by [Angelo Frangione](https://github.com/AngeloFrangione)
* 中文 (繁體) - *Traditional Chinese* by [zhtw2013](https://github.com/zhtw2013)

### How to help
* Fork the repository
* Edit / create files you want to add
* Create a pull request

**Important note :** you **must not** delete any translated element in any file, as older version that are still using them may become untranslated.
As these files are text only files, they will never take much space on devices, there is no need to be economical.

I will do my best to add it quick, **many thanks** !
